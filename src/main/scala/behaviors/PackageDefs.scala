/**
 * Enhances the `nestedBehavior` by adding the [[Inquisitive.ask]] capability, allowing the nested behavior to make structured questions and handle corresponding answers seamlessly.
 *
 * The `inquisitiveNesting` achieves this by:
 * 1. Wrapping the provided `nestedBehavior` within an [[Inquisitive]] interceptor,
 *    which manages the lifecycle of questions and their corresponding answers.
 * 2. Automatically handling responses that were not explicitly asked for via a
 *    configurable fallback `unaskedAnswerBehavior` (default: [[Ignore]]).
 *
 * **Purpose**:
 * - Simplify question-response workflows without requiring explicit state management.
 * - Enable nested behaviors to seamlessly issue questions and handle responses inline using the `ask` capability, reducing boilerplate and improving clarity.
 *
 * **Parameters**:
 * @param reactant              The `ReactantRelay` representing the context in which the questions and answers are exchanged.
 * @param nestedBehavior        The primary behavior of the reactant, extended with the ability to make structured questions.
 * @param unaskedAnswerBehavior A fallback behavior used to handle unexpected answers that do not correspond to a previously asked question. Defaults to [[Ignore]].
 * @tparam M The type of messages handled by the nested behavior.
 * @tparam A The type of answers, constrained to extend [[Answer]].
 * @tparam U A supertype of `A`, representing the broader type of messages that can be handled by the [[Inquisitive]] interceptor.
 *
 * @return A new behavior that combines the `nestedBehavior`'s message-handling capabilities with the [[Inquisitive.ask]] mechanism for structured question-response handling.
