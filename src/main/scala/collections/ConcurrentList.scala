	 * Retrieves the element that follows the given element in this list, treating the list as circular (i.e., the tail connects to the head with a `null` in between).
	 *
	 *		- If the provided `element` is `null`, the [[head]] element is returned.
	 *		- Returns `null` if the list is empty or the provided element is the last of the list.
	 *		- Handles cases where the provided `element` has been removed from the list:
	 *			- Returns the first non-removed element that followed the provided `element`.
	 *			- If no such element exists, returns `null`.
	 *
	 * Thread-safety: The method synchronizes access to both the provided `element` and its next element to ensure safe concurrent usage. The list itself is synchronized only when the [[head]] is involved (which happens when the provided element is `null` or the last of the list).
	 *
	 * Deadlock Safety: Nodes are always locked in a consistent order: the current element is locked before accessing or locking its successor (nextElem).
	 *
	 * Constant time removal at the cost of navigation overhead: The traversal logic simultaneously skips and removes logically deleted elements (isRemoved). This ensures the list structure remains clean with minimal overhead.
	 * // TODO to skip removed elements requires a nested synchronization. Surely removing the [[Node.removed]] field would improve the navigation speed at the cost a removing at O(n) instead of O(1). Consider changing this.
	 *
	 *
	 * @param element The element whose successor is to be retrieved.
	 * @return The next non-removed element after the provided `element`, or `null` if it is the last non-removed element of the list or the list is empty.
